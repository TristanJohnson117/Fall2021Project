This project was a very rewarding project as it opened me up to CSS, HTML, Javascript, and JQuery.  
Initially, both me and my partner were nervous about doing a project which operated outside of Python, as this course focused on Python, but we wanted to do something which would challenge us further and was more web related.
As a result, we spent many hours learning the tools and languages we would need to implement the code.  We were impressed with the work we had done, although we knew that there was a lot of room for improvement in the future as we better developed our skills. 
What we enjoyed the most, was the creation of our formulas in javascript, and how we got our website to react when a person was over the emissions limit.  At first, this proved very challenging as well as being very frustrating, because we had the logic for what we wanted to do in python, but, we found that it was more complicated to implement our formulas and have the website properly react to our calculations in javascript because of the differences between the languages.
In total, we both found that we enjoyed working with HTML, CSS, JS, and JQuery, and we hope to  further our studies and abilities in these languages in the future.
