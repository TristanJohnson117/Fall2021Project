Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We have set up the formulas in Javascript, and set up the buttons and basic web page for the site using HTML.  

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have not set up the site so that a red alert pops up when the user is above the average, nor the green alert when the user is below the average.  We also have not set up our tabs yet, where we will place the tips for the user.  We also want to set up the site so that when the user is above the average, on top of the red alert, they are shown two buttons to either resubmit their results, or go straight to the tips page where they can see how to lower their results

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

None.
