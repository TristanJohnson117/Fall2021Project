# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
Carbon Emissions Calculator - using HTML & python: 
We would prompt the user to enter their weekly miles driven in order to keep track of their car emissions that affect the environment.  Our site will also plan to compare the users average weekly carbon output with that of the national average, so that the user can know whether or not they are above or below the standard and acceptable output. We will prompt users for their name, vehicle fuel type, miles per gallon, and miles driven in the past week. Our project will help the UN in creating a more sustainable and healthier environment.



## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to collaborate with one student, Rakan Alqtaishat

## Do you have any questions of your own?

How would I merge the python functions I have made, with my HTML page?
